# Guidelines for Home Quarantine

## Introduction

* Persons and household members should be educated about personal hygiene, basic IPC measures and how to care for the member of the family suspected of having COVID-19 disease as safely as possible to prevent the infection from spreading to household contacts.
* The persons and the family should be provided with ongoing support and education, and monitoring should continue for the duration of home care.



## Recommendations

* Persons and families should adhere to the following recommendations:-
  * Place the person in a well-ventilated single room \(i.e . with open windows and an open door\)
  * Limit the movement of the person in the house and minimize shared space. Ensure that shared spaces \(e.g., kitchen, bathroom\) are well ventilated \(e.g., keep windows open\).
  * Household members should stay in a different room or, if that is not possible. maintain a distance of at least 1 mt from the ill person.
  * Limit the number of caregivers, ideally, assign one person who is in a good health and has no underlying chronic or immuno compromised conditions. Visitors should not be allowed until the person has completely recovered and has no signs and symptoms.
  * Perform hand hygiene after any type of contact with person or their immediate environment. Hand hygiene should also be performed before and after preparing food, before eating, after using the toilets and whenever hands look dirty. If hands are not visibly dirty. an alcohol-based hand rub can be used For visibly dirty hands, use soap and water.
  * When washing hands with soap and water, it is preferable to use

    disposable paper towels to dry hands. If these are not available. use clean cloth rowels and replace them when they become wet. Disposable paper towels should be disposed off in closed bins only.

  * To contain respiratory secretions, a medical mask should be provided to the person and worn as much as possible. Materials used to cover the mouth and nose should be discarded or cleaned appropriately after use \(e.g., wash handkerchiefs using regular soap or detergent and water\).
  * Caregivers should wear a tightly fitted medical mask that covers their mouth and nose when in the same room as the person. Masks should not be touched or handled during use If the mask gets wet or dirty from secretions, it must be replaced immediately with a new clean, dry mask. Remove the mask using the appropriate technique â€” that is, do not touch the front, but instead untie it Discard the mask immediately after use and perform hand hygiene.
  * Avoid direct contact with body fluids, particularly oral or respiratory

    secretions, and stool. Use disposal gloves and a mask when providing oral or respiratory care and when handling stool, urine. and other waste. Perform hand hygiene before and after removing gloves and mask.

  * Do not reuse masks or gloves
  * Use dedicated linen and eating utensils for the person; these items should

    be cleaned with soap and water after use and may be re-used instead of being discarded. They should be washed at 60-90 oC with common household detergent, and dry thoroughly. Place contaminated linen into a laundry bag.

  * Clean and disinfect daily surfaces that are frequently touched in the room where the person is being cared for, such as bedside tables. bed frames and other bedroom furniture. Regular household soap or detergent should be used first for cleaning, and then, after rinsing, regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite \( i.e., equivalent to 5000 pm or 1 part bleach 5 to 9 parts water\) should be applied.
  * Clean and disinfect bathroom and toilet surfaces at least once daily. Regular household soap or detergent should be used first for cleaning. and then, after rinsing, regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% to 1% sodium hypochlorite should be applied.
  * Avoid other types of exposure to contaminated items from the person's immediate environment \(e.g.. do not share toothbrushes, cigarettes. eating utensils, dishes, drinks, towels, washcloths or bed linen\).
